Possibility to add a new exercise and mody existing exercises


Tech stack:
    - form validation library: zod
    - form library: react-hook-form



Conventions:
    - use types instead of interfaces
    - only generate form field components that are used
    - keep the required route files as clean as possible, put for, related code in components
    - put code that handles creation and editing of an exercise in services/exercises.server.ts 
    - when creating a form component for both adding and editing an exercise, try to re-use as much code as possible
