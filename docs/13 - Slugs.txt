13 - Slugs

Urls like http://localhost:5177/exercises/a3d01cc2-1d0f-47c3-a621-908e04be0ff8 are not very human friendly.

Urls should look more like http://localhost:5177/exercises/approach-shot-warmup
if the title is "Approach Shot Warmup"

Plan

- create a universal sluggify-function that can be re-used
- the "sluggified" value should contain safe characters only
    - a-Z
    - 0-9
    - "-", "_"
    - if you think of other safe characters that should be included, feel free to suggest
- the slug should be stored along the value that was used as a source for the slug itself. Create
new table columns as needed.
