Exercise filter

I need a way for the visitors to be able to search for exercises using given filters.

- display on the exercise listing page, below the title and before the list
- make it an own component
  - separate visuals from search logic
- utilize debouncing to minimize the amount of api requests made



Available filters:

    - exercise types are found in the database
        - it should be possible to select 0 or more exercise types
        - selecting a parent, you implicitly select any child exercises
    - exercise title
        - a minimum of 3 characters must be typed, before search is triggered
        - any whole parts of the title should be searchable
            - if the whole title is "A lazy cat walked down the street",
              then searches for "cat", "A laz" and "walk" should be considered positive matches,
              while searches for "cas" "wlk" should be considered as failing matches
            - if possible, search should be case insensitive


    For reference, see files:
    - app/types.ts
        - type ExerciseTypeOption
    - app/services/exerciseTypes.server.ts
        - function fetchExerciseTypeOptions()
    - prisma/schema.prisma
        - model ExerciseType



Implementation

1) Plan

- create a plan for how to implement the exercise filter
- show how you would split the visuals from the logic
- show me a suggested structure

2) Ask

- if unsure about specs or implementation, ask me for clearance


3) Implement

Only implement when I have accepted the plan
