Possibility to add a new exercise and mody existing exercises


Tech stack:
    - form validation library: zod
    - form library: react-hook-form



Conventions:
    - use types instead of interfaces
    - only generate form field components that are used
    - keep the required route files as clean as possible, put for, related code in components
    - put code that handles creation and editing of an exercise in services/exercises.server.ts 
    - when creating a form component for both adding and editing an exercise, try to re-use as much code as possible


 Phase 2 - deleting exercises

 We now have a button for deleting an exercise that is open for editing.

 Currently the button does nothing except asks the user to confirm the deletion.

 Implement deleting of an exercise.

 Show an error message on the page, if deleting the exercise failed.

 If the exercise was deleted successfully, show a message that the exercise was deleted.
 The message should disappear after a configurable amount of seconds and after that,m the user should be
 redirected back to the exercise listing page. The user should be able to dismiss the message faster,
 the use chooses, by clicking a "Go back to the exercise page" link.

Phase 3 - updated unit tests

Add unit tests that verify that deleting an exercise works as expected.

Create a test that first adds 5 exercises to database and then deletes one of them and checks that
the database contains expected exercises.

Create a test that first adds 5 exercises to database and then tries to delete a non-existing exercise
and then verifies that the database still contains expected exercises.
