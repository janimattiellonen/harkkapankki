Select exercises



When arriving to the exercises web site, the user is presented with two choices
1) Design a practise event
2) Browse exercises


If the user chooses "Design a practise event", the user presented with a form, where the user
can select 0 or more exercises for the practise event.

For example, the user may select:
- 2 exercises for warm-up
- 1 exercise for putting practise
- 2 exercises for throwing practise
- 1 exercise for closing

The page shows a total estimated time required for the selected practises.
The user may choose a 60 minute or a 90 minute practise event and plan accordingly.


If the user chooses "Browse exercises", the user is presented with available exercise types:
- Technique
- Games, plays and challenges
- Supplementary exercises
- All games

Each type could be presented as a big box with an image representing the type along with
the type title.

Each box is a clickable link navigating to a page that lists all exercises for the selected
exercise type.

This makes it more visually appealing to the user, instead of just vertical list of exercise
types (as text)



IMPLEMENTATION

Phase 1 - Frontpage
Status: DONE

Create two clickable boxes that are rendered horizontally, if space. Each box should take about 50% of
horizontal space with some gap between. On smaller devices, the boxes should be rendered vertically.

Each box should render an image and a title text. The text should be rendered centered,
both vertically and horizontally. The text could have a background that is somewhat transparent
with a blur filter. Use a shade of gray as the background. This to make the title text always readable,
no matter what background image is used.

The image should cover the whole box. Use appropriate css styles so that the image is not scaled weirdly.

Box #1:
- image: assets/images/exercise-plan.png
- title text: Design a practise event
- link: no target available yet, implement an empty link

Box #2:
- image: assets/images/piggybank.jpeg
- title text: Exercise bank
- link: no target available yet, implement an empty link


Read the pasted text, plan, and execute Phase 1 if not marked as DONE.

Phase 2 - Exercise selection form
Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

Technical name to use in code:
- practiseSession(s)
- route: practise-sessions/new


Implementation of phase 2

In phase 2, we don't care about database structure nor about persisting or fetching data to and
from the database. In this phase we want to test the feasibility of the UI and iterate it until it feels
stable and functioning.

Initially, the practise event form has:
- practise event length selection
    - 60 minutes or 90 minutes
    - should be designed so that 1-n selections are possible
    - can be assumed that length is always in minutes
- 4 sections that are empty by default

The practise event form initially contains 4 empty sections:
- introduction
- warm-up
- technique
- closing

Each section allows the user to select 0 or more items from a list of available items. Each section has
its own list of items that are only available to the specific section.

Each section has a default length. For example, introduction and closing are both typically 5 minutes.
Note that the section length may vary depending on the selected length of the practise event.


Initially available sections:
    - Introduction
        - selectable items:
            - Throwing order
            - Ob rules
        - section length in minutes: 5

    - Warm-up
        - selectable items:
            - Motor skill
            - Muscle condition
        - section length in minutes
            - practise length 60 minutes: 10
            - practise length 90 minutes: 20
    - Technique
        - selectable items:
            - Putting
            - Driving
        - section length in minutes
            - practise length 60 minutes: 40
            - practise length 90 minutes: 60
    - Closing
        - selectable items:
            - Closing
        - section length in minutes: 5


Use the above listed available sections in the form. Generate uuid values as ids for each item.
Use 'label' for the human readable value and 'value' for the uuid. Not that each section may have
0-n selected items. Allow the user to add new items and remove added items. Same item may not be
added twice.

Before generating actual code in the project, plan and suggest a solution.


Section (database):
- table name: sections
- fields:
    - id (uuid, primary key)
    - created_at
    - updated_at

SectionTranslation (database);
- table name: section_translations
- fields:
    - id (uuid, primary key)
    - section_id
    - language
    - name
    - description (nullable)
    - created_at
    - updated_at
