Select exercises



When arriving to the exercises web site, the user is presented with two choices
1) Design a practise event
2) Browse exercises


If the user chooses "Design a practise event", the user presented with a form, where the user
can select 0 or more exercises for the practise event.

For example, the user may select:
- 2 exercises for warm-up
- 1 exercise for putting practise
- 2 exercises for throwrng practise
- 1 exercise for closing

The page shows a total estimated time required for the selected practises.
The user may choose a 60 minute or a 90 minute practise event and plan accordingly.


If the user chooses "Browse exercises", the user is presented with available exercise types:
- Technique
- Games, plays and challenges
- Supplementary exercises
- All games

Each type could be presented as a big box with an image representing the type along with
the type title.

Each box is a clickable link navigating to a page that lists all exercises for the selected
exercise type.

This makes it more visually appealing to the user, instead of just vertical list of exercise
types (as text)



IMPLEMENTATION

Phase 1 - Frontpage

Create two clickable boxes that are rendered horizontally, if space. Each box should take about 50% of
horizontal space with some gap between. On smaller devices, the boxes should be rendered vertically.

Each box should render an image and a title text. The text should be rendered centered,
both vertically and horizontally. The text could have a background that is somewhat transparent
with a blur filter. Use a shade of gray as the background. This to make the title text always readable,
no matter what background image is used.

The image should cover the whole box. Use appropriate css styles so that the image is not scaled weirdly.

Box #1:
- image: assets/images/exercise-plan.png
- title text: Design a practise event
- link: no target available yet, implement an empty link

Box #2:
- image: assets/images/piggybank.jpeg
- title text: Exercise bank
- link: no target available yet, implement an empty link


Read the pasted text, plan, and execute Phase 1
