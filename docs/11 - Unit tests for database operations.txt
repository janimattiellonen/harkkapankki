Unit tests for database operations

Description

I want my app to be safe from regression due to changes. I need unit tests for functionality that inserts,
updates and deletes data to and from database.

I want to use a real database so that the tests are authentic.

Plan

Devise a plan on how to set up a testing environment that utilizes a real database and that is easy to setup.

Adding new test data should be pain free.

Without creating actual code yet, show me how a single unit tests would look like that:
- inserts a new exercise using the function createExercise found in app/services/exercises.server.ts
- makes sure that exercise was created properly
